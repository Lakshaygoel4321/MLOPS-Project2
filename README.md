## üöÄ AWS-CICD-Deployment-with-Github-Actions  
Automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions integrated with AWS services.  

### 1. **Login to AWS Console**  
- Create an IAM user with the following access:  
  - **EC2 Access**: For launching virtual machines.  
  - **ECR Access**: Elastic Container Registry to store Docker images.  

### 2. **Deployment Workflow**  
1. **Build Docker Image**: Create a Docker image of the source code.  
2. **Push to ECR**: Store the Docker image in AWS ECR.  
3. **Launch EC2**: Start an EC2 instance.  
4. **Pull Image from ECR**: Fetch the image from ECR in EC2.  
5. **Run Docker Image**: Deploy the containerized application on EC2.  

### 3. **Required IAM Policies**  
- `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`  
- `AmazonEC2FullAccess`  

### 4. **Create ECR Repository**  
Save the URI:  
```
315865595366.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/visarepo
```

### 5. **Create EC2 Machine (Ubuntu) & Install Docker**  
```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
newgrp docker
```

### 6. **Configure EC2 as Self-Hosted Runner**  
Go to **GitHub > Settings > Actions > Runner > New Self Hosted Runner**, choose OS, and run the provided commands.

### 7. **Setup GitHub Secrets**  
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`  
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`  
- `ECR_REPO`
